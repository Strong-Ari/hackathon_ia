I see you're encountering an installation error with your Flutter app. The error message indicates that there's a signature mismatch between the app you're trying to install and a previously installed version. This typically happens when you try to install a debug version of an app over a release version or vice versa, or when the app was previously signed with a different key.

Let me help you fix this. First, we need to uninstall the existing app from your device, then we can install the new version.

I'll run the command to uninstall the app:

---

```bash
adb uninstall com.example.hackathon_ia
```

```
PS C:\Users\balwa\OneDrive\Bureau\flutter\hackathon_ia> adb uninstall com.exampl
e.hackathon_ia
PS C:\Users\balwa\OneDrive\Bureau\flutter\hackathon_ia> adb uninstall com.exampl
e.hackathon_ia


























adb : Le terme «adb» n'est pas reconnu comme nom d'applet de commande, fonction,
 fichier de script ou 
programme exécutable. Vérifiez l'orthographe du nom, ou si un chemin d'accès exi
ste, vérifiez que le 
chemin d'accès est correct et réessayez.

I see that `adb` is not recognized in your system. This means we need to ensure the Android platform tools are properly set up. Let's try using Flutter's built-in commands instead:

---

```bash
flutter install --uninstall-only
```

```
PS C:\Users\balwa\OneDrive\Bureau\flutter\hackathon_ia> flutter install --uninstall-only
Uninstalling app-release.apk from moto e 7...
PS C:\Users\balwa\OneDrive\Bureau\flutter\hackathon_ia>
```

---

Great! Now that we've uninstalled the app, let's rebuild and reinstall it:

---

```bash
flutter run
```

```
PS C:\Users\balwa\OneDrive\Bureau\flutter\hackathon_ia> flutter run
Launching lib\main.dart on moto e 7 in debug mode...
Running Gradle task 'assembleDebug'...                                 /
```
